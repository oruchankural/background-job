# Quartz.NET Scheduler with ASP.NET Core

This is a basic example of using Quartz.NET as a scheduler in an ASP.NET Core application to process data in batches. It schedules jobs to run at different times, 2 minutes apart, and ensures that jobs of the same type do not run concurrently.

## Prerequisites

- .NET 5 or later
- Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code (optional)

## Getting Started

1. Clone or download this repository.

2. Open the project in Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code (optional).

3. Run the application.

4. Use a tool like Postman or cURL to make a POST request to `/api/data` with a JSON array of Data objects to trigger the jobs.

## Project Structure

- `Program.cs`: Main entry point for the application.
- `Startup.cs`: Configuration of services and middleware.
- `DataController.cs`: Defines the API endpoint to trigger jobs.
- `Jobs/InsertLogToDatabase.cs`: The Quartz.NET job that processes data in batches.
- `Models/Data.cs`: A sample data model.
- `appsettings.json`: Configuration settings (not used in this example).
- `requestBody.json`: Request body for POST request

## Best Practices

- Use dependency injection to manage the Quartz scheduler as a singleton service.
- Avoid hardcoding values like job names or intervals. Use variables or configuration files for such values.
- Use `JobKey` to uniquely identify jobs. In this example, each job has a unique name with an index.
- Set a unique identity for each job and use it consistently when creating triggers.
- Start jobs at different times to avoid concurrent execution.
- Use `[DisallowConcurrentExecution]` to prevent jobs of the same type from running concurrently.
- Implement error handling and logging in your jobs as needed.
- Monitor and manage your Quartz.NET scheduler in a production environment.
- Keep the `Startup.cs` file clean by moving the scheduler configuration to a separate class or extension method for better maintainability.

Feel free to customize and expand upon this example to meet your specific requirements.
